IPv6 error code 
.SS "#define LIBNET_DONT_RESOLVE   0"
Used for libnet's name resolution functions, specifies that no DNS lookups should be performed and the IP address should be kept in numeric form\&. 
.SS "#define LIBNET_ERRBUF_SIZE   0x100"
The libnet error buffer is 256 bytes long\&. 
.SS "#define LIBNET_MAX_PACKET   0xffff"
The biggest an IP packet can be -- 65,535 bytes\&. 
.SS "#define LIBNET_MAXOPTION_SIZE   0x28"
IP and TCP options can be up to 40 bytes long\&. 
.SS "#define LIBNET_OFF   1"
Used several places, to specify 'on' or 'one' 
.SS "#define LIBNET_ON   0"
Used several places, to specify 'on' or 'one' 
.SS "#define LIBNET_PR2   0"
Used for \fBlibnet_get_prand()\fP to specify function disposition 
.SS "#define LIBNET_RESOLVE   1"
Used for libnet's name resolution functions, specifies that a DNS lookup can be performed if needed to resolve the IP address to a canonical form\&.
